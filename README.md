# Twitter Sentiment Analysis on Sudan Crisis
 Using social media tweets to find out patterns on the world's view about the latest crisis across the world.


The following is a script written natively on Python to perform Sentiment Analysis on Twitter Data using the TweePy Library in Python. 
The data is downloaded locally on the machine using the developer information that can be obtained from Twitter's Developer Controls. 
The program aims to use technologies like NLTK and Naive Bayes Classifier to perform sentiment Analysis on the Tweets and to find out the different kinds of positive and negative tweets being circulated about the same issue. It uses a Naive Bayes approach to classsify tweets as positive, negative or neutral.
The use case of this project is not limited to the Sudan Crisis, in fact, this project can be used to simply perform Sentiment Analysis on any kind of textual data, whether or not from Twitter.
